# GUI Responsiveness Issue Summary

## The Problem

The application's graphical user interface (GUI) was becoming unresponsive or "hanging" during long-running computations. This was because the computationally intensive simulation tasks, which are managed by the Sim4Life API, were being executed on the same main thread as the GUI. Since the Sim4Life API calls are blocking, they would prevent the GUI from processing any events (like redrawing the window or responding to button clicks) until the task was complete.

Initial attempts to solve this by moving the simulation logic to a separate background thread failed. This approach introduced new, more severe errors, including deadlocks and crashes (`ACIS : operation unsuccessful`). These errors revealed a fundamental limitation: the Sim4Life API is not thread-safe and its core components must be called from the main application thread.

## The Solution

Given the constraints of the Sim4Life API, a more pragmatic solution was implemented. Instead of pursuing a complex and unstable multi-threaded architecture, the simulation logic remains on the main thread, but with a crucial improvement.

By strategically inserting calls to `QApplication.processEvents()` within the main study loop, we allow the GUI to periodically process its event queue. This happens between major computational steps.

### How it Works:

- The `_check_for_stop_signal()` method in the `BaseStudy` class, which is called frequently throughout the study, was modified to include a call to `self.gui.process_events()`.
- This forces the application to handle any pending GUI updates, such as redrawing the progress bars, updating text, and responding to user input like the "Stop" button.

### Trade-offs and Benefits:

- **Benefit:** This solution is stable and eliminates the threading-related crashes and deadlocks.
- **Benefit:** The application no longer enters a permanent "Not Responding" state. The user receives periodic updates on the progress.
- **Trade-off:** The GUI will still be momentarily unresponsive *during* a single, long-running Sim4Life operation. However, it will become responsive again as soon as that specific operation finishes, before the next one begins.

This approach provides a much-improved user experience by ensuring the GUI remains interactive and provides feedback, while respecting the technical limitations of the underlying simulation library.
