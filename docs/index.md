## Overview

GOLIAT is a robust and automated Python framework for conducting both **near-field** and **far-field** dosimetric assessments using the Sim4Life simulation platform.

The framework is designed to be:

- **Modular** - Clean separation of concerns with well-defined components
- **Scalable** - Handle large simulation matrices efficiently
- **Reproducible** - Consistent results across different runs
- **User-friendly** - Real-time GUI with progress tracking

## Key Features

### üéØ Near-Field Studies
Conduct SAR simulations with device antennas placed close to phantom models, supporting various:

- Device placements and orientations
- Multiple frequency bands
- Child and adult phantom models
- Automated antenna positioning

### üåê Far-Field Studies
Perform whole-body exposure simulations from incident plane waves:

- Multiple incident directions
- Various polarizations
- Environmental and auto-induced scenarios
- Comprehensive SAR analysis

### üöÄ Cloud Computing
Scale your simulations with integrated oSPARC support:

- Batch job submission
- Automated result downloading
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Parallel execution

### üìä Advanced Analysis
Comprehensive post-processing capabilities:

- Tissue-specific SAR calculations
- Whole-body and organ-level metrics
- Automated report generation
- Statistical analysis and visualization
