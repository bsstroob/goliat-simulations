## Overview

GOLIAT automates dosimetric assessments for the GOLIAT project, calculating SAR in digital human phantoms from device or environmental EMF exposure. Key features:

- Modular scene building (phantoms, antennas, plane waves).
- Local or cloud execution (iSolve/oSPARC).
- Results extraction and analysis (SAR metrics, plots).
- GUI for progress tracking.

Start with the [Quick Start](quick_start.md) to run your first simulation.

## Why GOLIAT?

- **Efficiency**: Handles setup, runs, and analysis in one tool.
- **Reproducible**: Config-driven for consistent results.
- **Scalable**: Local parallel or cloud batching for large studies.
- **Accessible**: Plain-language docs for newcomers.
