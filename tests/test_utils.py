# Not testing profile, profile_subtask, ensure_s4l_running, open_project,
# delete_project_file, suppress_stdout_stderr as they require more complex
# mocking or interaction with Sim4Life, which is out of scope for these simple tests.
# The simple Profiler in utils.py is also not tested here as the main profiler
# in profiler.py is already covered.
