# High-Level Plan for Enhancing GOLIAT GitHub Repository

## Overview
The GOLIAT project is a sophisticated Python framework for automated near-field and far-field dosimetric simulations using Sim4Life. The current repository is functional but lacks polish for newcomers: documentation is sparse and technical, README is dense without visual appeal, no CI/CD, no formal release, and limited contributor guidance. The goal is to transform it into a professional, approachable open-source project with a "casually good" vibe ‚Äì like a seasoned developer's effortless masterpiece.

I'll break this into phased tasks, starting with documentation (as requested), then README, GitHub features, and code quality. This plan is iterative; I'll adjust based on discoveries (e.g., code review may reveal more docs needs). Estimated effort: large, multi-session.

## Phase 1: Documentation Overhaul (Priority: High ‚Äì Foundation for Users)
Current docs/ is basic: architecture overview, config guide, API stubs, UML. It's developer-focused but overwhelming for newcomers. Expand to create a welcoming, tutorial-driven experience.

### Key Improvements
- **Structure**: Use MkDocs hierarchy: Home > Quick Start > User Guide > Tutorials > Configuration > API > Developer Guide > Architecture.
- **Content Additions**:
  - **Quick Start Tutorial**: Step-by-step "Hello World" simulation (e.g., single near-field run). Include screenshots (ask user if needed).
  - **User Guide**: End-to-end workflows for near/far-field, free-space validation, parallel runs, oSPARC batching. Explain concepts (SAR, phantoms, plane waves) simply.
  - **Tutorials**:
    - Basic: Run a study with default config.
    - Intermediate: Customize placements/frequencies.
    - Advanced: Cloud batching, analysis scripting.
  - **Configuration Deep Dive**: Expand configs/documentation.md into interactive examples (JSON snippets with explanations). Fix errors (e.g., clarify far-field directions: no "xy_pos" as direction; use single axes like x_pos).
  - **API Reference**: Auto-generate with Sphinx or MkDocs plugins (beyond current stubs). Include examples for key classes (e.g., NearFieldStudy.run()).
  - **Developer Guide**: Contribution workflow, testing, extending setups (e.g., new antenna models).
  - **Troubleshooting**: Common issues (e.g., Sim4Life licensing, oSPARC auth, lock files).
  - **Glossary**: Expand abbreviations.md (SAR, psSAR, etc.).
- **Visuals**: More Mermaid diagrams (workflows, class relations). Embed UML. Add code snippets with syntax highlighting.
- **Style**: Professional yet casual ‚Äì short sections, bullet points, "pro tips". Ensure mobile-friendly.
- **Build/Deploy**: Update mkdocs.yml for GitHub Pages. Add deploy action later.
- **Files to Create/Edit**:
  - docs/quick_start.md
  - docs/user_guide.md
  - docs/tutorials/basic.md, intermediate.md, advanced.md
  - docs/troubleshooting.md
  - docs/developer_guide.md
  - Update existing: index.md (landing), configuration.md (expand), api.md (flesh out), architecture_overview.md (simplify).
  - Remove/rework: old_good_GUI-Profiling-Logger.md (integrate into developer guide), COLORING_RULES.md (move to dev guide).

**Timeline**: 2-3 sessions. Review code in src/ for accuracy (e.g., explain Study classes, Setup components).

## Phase 2: README Enhancement (Priority: High ‚Äì First Impression)
Current README is comprehensive but wall-of-text. Make it "simple and sexy": scannable, visual, inviting.

### Key Improvements
- **Name**: Keep "GOLIAT Automatic Simulation Framework" ‚Äì it's descriptive. Tagline: "Effortless EMF Dosimetry Simulations for Near- and Far-Field Scenarios".
- **Structure** (Keep concise, ~500 words):
  - Hero Section: Bold intro, key features (modular, scalable, GUI/cloud support), badges (Python 3.11+, MIT License, docs, tests ‚Äì add later).
  - Quick Install/Run: 3-step code blocks (clone, pip install -r requirements.txt, python run_study.py).
  - Features: Bulleted highlights with icons (e.g., üéØ Near-Field, üåê Far-Field, üöÄ oSPARC).
  - Screenshots: GUI, results plots (ask user for any missing).
  - Usage: High-level (load config, run). Link to docs for details.
  - Architecture: Brief Mermaid workflow diagram.
  - Contributing: How to fork, test, submit PRs.
  - License: MIT (add LICENSE if missing).
  - Footer: Links to docs, issues, cite paper if applicable.
- **Style**: Casual-good ‚Äì "Pull this off like it's no big deal." Use emojis sparingly, clean markdown.
- **Badges**: Add: docs, license, Python version, build status (post-CI).

**Timeline**: 1 session. Rewrite iteratively.

## Phase 3: GitHub Actions & CI/CD (Priority: Medium ‚Äì Professionalism) ‚úì
Add automation for reliability.

### Key Improvements ‚úì
- **Actions**: ‚úì
  - Lint/Test: `.github/workflows/test.yml` ‚Äì Run pytest on push/PR, black/flake8 linting. Use requirements.txt (no Poetry).
  - Docs Build: `.github/workflows/docs.yml` ‚Äì Build MkDocs, deploy to gh-pages.
  - Release: `.github/workflows/release.yml` ‚Äì On tag, create v1.0 release with changelog, assets.
- **Tests**: ‚úì Fixed syntax errors in `tests/test_config.py`. Basic test coverage in place.
- **Templates**: ‚úì
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` ‚Äì Bug reporting template
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` ‚Äì Feature request template
  - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` ‚Äì PR checklist and guidelines
- **Release v1.0**: Ready to tag when user approves.

**Status**: Complete. All GitHub Actions workflows and templates created.

## Phase 4: Code Quality & Polish (Priority: Medium ‚Äì Maintainability) ‚úì
- **Style**: ‚úì Enforce black/isort via pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
- **Documentation**: ‚úì
  - `CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äì Version history tracking
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` ‚Äì Contributor Covenant
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` ‚Äì Comprehensive contribution guidelines
  - `LICENSE` ‚Äì MIT License
- **Requirements**: requirements.txt in place (user prefers not to pin versions).
- **gitignore**: Existing .gitignore appears adequate.

**Status**: Complete. All quality and documentation files created.

## Risks & Questions
- Screenshots: Need user-provided for GUI/results?
- Name Change: Stick with GOLIAT or suggest alternative?
- Scope: Focus on docs first; confirm before GitHub actions.

## Next Steps
- Review src/ code for doc accuracy.
- Implement Phase 1, iterate plan.
- Switch to Code mode for file edits.
